Accurate and high performance C++ interop code generator for C#.

## Features

* Accurate, fast code-gen for C++ and COM interfaces from their C++ headers.
* No dependencies on .NET Runtime COM support
* Supports passing code-gen information through MSBuild project and package references
* Pluggable Runtime Library Name and runtime support type names (default library is SharpGen.Runtime)
  * Projects that implement their own SharpGenTools runtime support classes can add mapping rules to ensure that their generated code uses their runtime support library.

## Components in this Repo

* SharpGen
  * The code-gen engine that runs CastXML to parse the C++ and then generates the C# interop code.
* SharpPatch
  * Patches the `calli` instructions for efficient C++ interop as well as other constructs not possible in C#
* SharpGenTools.Sdk
  * MSBuild tooling to integrate SharpGen and SharpPatch directly into projects
* SharpGen.Runtime
  * Runtime support classes for code generated by SharpGen.
* SharpGen.Interactive
  * Legacy command line front-end for SharpGen with Avalonia progress-dialog
  * Xplat version of original SharpGen application
* SharpPatch.Cli
  * Legacy command line front-end for SharpPatch
  * The original SharpCli application

## Requirements

### To Use

* Any projects using the SDK to generate code must use new SDK-style projects with MSBuild 15.3 or higher (.NET Core 2.0 SDK or VS 2017.3)
* Make any mapping files a `SharpGenMapping` item in your `.csproj`.

### To Build

* MSBuild 15.3 or newer.
* .NET Core 2.0
* CMake 3.0 or newer.
